          their high schools, colleges, and previous work experiences. The data is gathered from the main Airtable survey
           members filled out upon joining RTC and presented in a timeline, allowing us to map the progress of each student's academic
           and early post-grad careers.<br></br><br></br>Curious about where RTC members are in the United States? We offer <b>big picture</b> views of the data as well.
           These visualizations were made using Tableau dashboards, and are live-updated every day with data from the Airtable. 
           Happy discovering! </p>
